it 's hard to know quite what motivated the duke of york to rescue teenage sex slaves in india at the same time he faced damning allegations that he had slept with one in america . but one thing is for certain : it definitely took guts . with a remarkable initiative combining the unlikely bedfellows of fashion and compassion , it can be revealed that prince andrew has personally changed the fate of more than 100 vulnerable young women in calcutta . rescued from brothels and domestic servitude , child labour and human trafficking , the girls have been taught tailoring and silk printing through a charity called key to freedom . moved : prince andrew during his visit to an indian refuge in 2012 , which inspired him to form the charity . their kimonos , duster coats , pyjamas , scarves and make-up bags are sold online and on the british high street by topshop , with the proceeds paid back to the women as a salary . what makes this new mission all the more compelling is it has emerged just months after andrew was mired in allegations that he had enjoyed an improper relationship with american ` sex slave ' virginia roberts , who had been working for his former friend jeffrey epstein , an american billionaire . the claims , furiously denied by the duke , have now been struck out of american court records , effectively clearing his name . he was inspired to launch key to freedom after visiting a girls ' refuge on an official trip to india . he came up with the idea less than an hour after leaving a home run by the women 's interlink foundation and swiftly donated # 10,000 seed capital to fund the first bales of silk . speaking exclusively to the mail on sunday yesterday , the duke said : ` i was incredibly impressed with the work of the women 's interlink foundation during my diamond jubilee visit to india in may 2012 . ` i could see that it would be possible to complement -lsb- founder and chairman -rsb- aloka mitra 's important work in supporting vulnerable young women to develop a skill to become economically active by helping find a route to market for their products . it is incredible to see what the team has achieved . roberts had been working for andrew 's former friend jeffrey epstein , an american billionaire -lrb- pictured together above -rrb- . ` i am proud to have helped their products find a market and be sold in the united kingdom . ` most importantly , this has helped the women 's interlink foundation support more young people to develop skills , which is an important area of focus for my work . ' one of the young women who moved him so deeply was anita , now 19 . she was chosen to show the duke how to block-print silk when he visited the refuge . in return , he left two copies of little red 's summer adventure , a book written by his former wife sarah . the child of two tea garden labourers from northern bengal , anita was abducted aged 12 when she went to a travelling fair with friends . lured to new delhi with the promise of a job to help her support her family , she escaped only to find herself living as a ` railway child ' at the city 's station . illiterate and destitute , she had no way home until she was taken in by the wif where she met the duke on his trip . she was among the first girls to sign up to key to freedom and has so far earned almost 40,000 rupees -- approximately # 430 -- supplying silk goods to topshop . she has also been reunited with her family near darjeeling . ` we traced her parents but they were resistant to her coming home because they believed she had been prostituted , ' revealed aloka . ` once we had told them her real story and that she 'd learned english and bengali and maths , and that she had a craft and was earning a living , they changed their mind . ' anita said : ` i am doing well now and so is my mother . she was sick and i have been able to pay for medical treatment for her . ` i have earned almost 40,000 rupees through key to freedom and i have a skill which will help my future . i hope i keep getting orders for my work . i hope it wo n't stop . ' prince andrew 's 25-year-old daughter , princess eugenie , and his former wife sarah , duchess of york , have both paid private visits to help support the charity , and it is understood they continue to play an active role in promoting the initiative . the duke 's eldest daughter beatrice , 26 , was recently criticised for taking as many as nine holidays in the space of just a few months , although she is understood to have recently accepted a job at a private equity firm in new york . eugenie also works in the city for an online auction house . other workers with key to freedom include taralika , 25 , who was taken prisoner in a red light area after running away from home . ` she was locked up in a brothel and beaten , and then starved for days for refusing to have sex , ' said aloka . profits : about # 20,000 from topshop sales has gone to the charity since it was set up with products sold in their uk stores . ` finally she escaped and found refuge in a youth club whose leaders called the police . she was , and still remains , mentally disturbed by her ordeal but she 's making excellent progress . she is happy and confident working as a tailor . ' another key to freedom success story is shila , 21 , an epilepsy sufferer who is so traumatised by her past that she has never been able to explain how she came to be on the streets of calcutta . aloka said : ` she now has a bank account like any other working woman . it has totally changed her life . ` poverty makes these women victims . they suffer ills because they have little or no capacity to earn . they live with abuse -- mental , physical and sexual -- just to be certain of food and shelter . ` the duke understood that and wanted to make a difference -- as the father of two daughters i think the plight of the girls here resonated with him . ` he wanted to given them their independence . handmade : a silk topshop kimono . ` there was no talk about a project or a donation at the time of his visit . the only thing he asked me was , `` what do you think it will take to rehabilitate these girls ? '' ` i spoke to him about alternative income earning , a regular outlet to sell their work , and skills development to make their craft more marketable . his aides called less than an hour after he 'd left and set up a meeting the same night . ` he had already spoken to the duchess of york about us and she expressed her wish to help out in whatever way she could . the name key to freedom was her idea . ' aloka added : ` while i understood that their heart was in the right place , i also wondered whether busy people like them would find time to give it more thought . ` not only did they find the time , they were incredibly enthusiastic and remain so today . ` it was prince andrew 's skills at connecting businesses that linked us to topshop . it 's nothing short of a miracle for us to have a market in the uk . ' aloka came to london for talks with the duke 's team at buckingham palace just three months after their initial meeting , and by summer 2013 key to freedom was up and running . it fulfilled its first order to topshop , every piece individually signed by the woman who made it , in july 2013 . since then approximately 4,300 items have been sold . yesterday , the high street giant , which sent designer penny mcivor to india to assist with colours , patterns and quality control , confirmed the original deal for four collections had been extended to include at least one more later this year . topshop declined to discuss sales figures , but it is understood around # 20,000 has so far been paid by the company , which makes no profit from the scheme , to the prince andrew charitable foundation . this then sends the money back to key to freedom in calcutta . in addition , the charity supplied 750 goodie bags for one of prince andrew 's pitch@palace events for entrepreneurs last month , where 200 of its scarves were also on sale . the scheme is another of his business-to-business initiatives uniting start-ups and entrepreneurs with angel investors , venture capitalists and mentors . a buckingham palace source said that the prince remained very supportive of the project and used every opportunity -- such as pitch@palace -- to promote it . ` it 's been completely empowering for the girls here , ' said aloka . ` it 's about honour and dignity , and having control over their own future . ` it means they can look ahead and put their past behind them .

arrested : doug hughes was put under arrest for his gyro-copter stunt and charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace . the postal carrier who flew a gyrocopter onto the lawn of the u.s. capitol is facing two criminal charges . but he 's being released from federal custody to return to florida . doug hughes made his initial appearance in u.s. district court in washington on thursday . that 's one day after he steered his tiny aircraft onto the capitol 's west lawn after flying through restricted airspace around the national mall . he was charged with operating an unregistered aircraft and violating national airspace . hughes said it was a political protest . hughes was released on his own recognizance afterward and instructed to check in weekly with authorities in tampa starting next week . in a soft voice , hughes appeared to ask the judge a clarifying question about that obligation but otherwise he did not say anything significant . homeland security secretary jeh johnson said thursday that the copter ` apparently literally flew in under the radar , ' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . johnson said it 's too soon to say whether wednesday 's incident should prompt changes in security procedures . ' i want to know all the facts before i reach an assessment of what can and should be done about gyrocopters in the future , ' he said . but lawmakers said the incident exposed a gap in security , especially amid revelations that the pilot , florida postal worker doug hughes , was interviewed by the secret service almost two years ago . the agency apparently determined he did not pose a threat , said rep. elijah cummings , d-md. , the senior democrat on the house oversight and government reform committee . cummings spoke thursday with the secret service director . ' i think that there 's absolutely a gap , and it 's a very dangerous gap , with regard to our airspace , ' cummings said . ' i do n't want people to get a message that they can just land anywhere . suppose there was a bomb or an explosive device on that air vehicle ? that could have been a major catastrophe . ' how 'd it happen ? homeland security secretary jeh johnson said thursday that the copter ` apparently literally flew in under the radar , ' as concerned lawmakers questioned how it was allowed to happen and why . approach : the small gyro-copter -lrb- circled in red -rrb- lands on the west lawn of the capitol in washington as members of the public walk by . the stunt has n't cost him his freedom , yet , but means he must check in with authorities every week as he awaits trial . johnson said the secret service passed along the information from the interview with hughes , who was to appear in court thursday afternoon , to ` all of the appropriate law enforcement agencies . ' house minority leader nancy pelosi , d-calif. , called the incident ` stunning . ' ` what safeguards can we use ? we do n't want to be a place where we 're saying ` this is an iron-clad capitol . ' and have such restrictions on people having access to it , ' pelosi told reporters . ` nonetheless , we have to ensure the safety of those people . ' the tiny , open-air aircraft landed without injuries to anyone , but the incident raises questions about how someone could be allowed to fly all the way from gettysburg , pennsylvania , right up to the capitol . hughes has said he was making the flight to publicize his concerns about the corrupting influence of money in politics , and deliver letters to all 535 members of congress on the topic . ` we are a democracy . we do n't have fences around our airspace , so we 've got to find the right balance between living in a free and open society and security and the protection of federal buildings , ' johnson told reporters on capitol hill . ` and so we want to stay one step ahead of every incident like this , but then again , you do n't want to overreact , either . ' still , lawmakers questioned why , if authorities had been in touch with hughes , no action was taken to stop him . practice run : doug hughes flies his gyrocopter near the wauchula municipal airport in wauchula , florida prior to his ` insane ' stunt on wednesday . before doug hughes made headlines by flying his open air helicopter onto the u.s. capitol grounds , he blogged about his intention to undertake the ` non-violent demonstration . ' though , it may have been a demonstration years in the making . in a post dated september 2013 on the democracyclub.org , a writer called tampadoug47 wrote : . let me say first -- this is a non-violent demonstration . i have no intention of hurting anyone -- i have taken every precaution to prevent any injury to anyone , including me . there is no way i can prevent over-reaction by the authorities , but i have given them as much information and advance warning as my fuel supply allows . when i took off , i was over an hour away from the no-fly zone . the demonstration is about restoring democracy . corruption in washington dc has robbed the us citizens of the representative government that is our birthright . polls show that the public is aware of the problem and very concerned , but they are largely uninformed that there is a solution and there are organizations prepared to make reform a reality . as a result of this flight , two things will happen . -lrb- i hope . -rrb- first , we 're going to change the narrative -- the story . voters are going to quit being played like suckers with divisive hot-button issues and come together on a single issue . honest government . congress wo n't start working for you or me when their big paycheck is from big business . lobbyists , special interests , unions . we have to make this happen . the political parties wo n't . congress sure wo n't . lobbyists love the status quo . the mainstream media -lrb- not the local media -rrb- is making a financial killing with mega-elections . it 's up to us . second , in every congressional race in 2016 , i want every candidate to take a stand on corruption . after this flight , we 're going to define exactly what reform means -- set a written standard -- and it 's that standard which candidates will have to endorse . or the candidate will have to defend to voters why he took a lesser position . the candidate who only wants to talk ` reform ' but wo n't endorse the real deal will be facing someone who will endorse real reform . that may be in the primary or the general election . giving you a choice is our job . the clear choice , establishment or reform , will be in place in just a year for just over 460 congressional races . you get to choose -lrb- that 's your job as a voter . -rrb- but for the first time in decades , you will have a meaningful choice . what do i want from you ? look over your options on the previous screen or the ` honor roll ' on the sidebar to the right . rootstrikers or wolf pac or represent.us . my favorite group is n't listed there -- it 's my own startup group : ` the civilist papers ` . find a group -lrb- or groups -rrb- that you are comfortable with and sign up . we 're not after money -- we want to know who you are and where you are so we can keep you informed . protest flight : doug hughes took off from an undisclosed location in washington d.c. and landed his gyro-copter on the west front lawn of the us capitol building . ` my concerns are the prior notice that he was going to do this and the lack of response , ' said rep. michael mccaul , r-texas , chairman of the house homeland security committee . ` these small aircraft or uav devices concern me because they could go undetected and cause damage , so that 's something we 're taking a look at , ' mccaul said , adding he might hold hearings on the issue . cummings and others also complained that they were not notified of the incident and that many first learned of it from the news media . johnson defended existing protocols for dealing with the restricted airspace over washington , d.c. , federal buildings and monuments . ` we 've got a well-coordinated federal response to dealing with issues of those who penetrate the restricted airspace without permission , ' he said . he said his first reaction on hearing of the incident was to ask , ` what 's a gyrocopter ? ' it 's not unusual for a small aircraft like a gyrocopter to go undetected by conventional radar . unlike most larger aircraft , a gyrocopter does n't have a transponder that identifies the aircraft , its altitude and heading . even without a transponder , radar can detect ` primary targets ' - planes , flocks of birds , rain and other objects . but how well it can detect those objects depends upon several factors . the landing on the capitol grounds ` just illustrates how hard it is to have an impermeable barrier . it 's very hard to hermetically seal airspace , ' said john hansman , a massachusetts institute of technology aeronautics professor . evidence : the illegally landed craft was piloted by florida mailman doug hughes to protest against government corruption and to promote campaign finance reform . evidence : the illegally landed craft was piloted by florida mailman doug hughes to protest against government corruption and to promote campaign finance reform .

' i did really well , got a really good time , i was in the top 20 per cent , so the next morning , i thought about doing the full tour . ' i thought , if i could do one day , is it possible to do the whole tour ? ` after the etape i should n't have wanted to even see a chopper again , but it was a bit of a eureka moment , that 's where it came from . ' i come from a cycling family , my mum and dad would take me to see the tour , riding up mountains is in my blood . ` it 's always been a bit of a dream to ride the tour de france , i wo n't do it again , my dad said he never would have thought i 'd do it on a chopper ! ' he said : ` part of the motivation was to show people you do n't need a # 10,000 bike to do amazing things on - my bike cost me # 100 , and i 'm doing the tour on it . with a bike , it 's mostly to do with the engine . ` in the last five years the cost of road cycling has sky rocketed but you do n't need all that , you just need to get out and ride . ` the other side of the challenge is to raise as much money for help for heroes as possible .
